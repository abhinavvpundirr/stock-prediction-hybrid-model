Hybrid Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning pipeline that combines LSTM neural networks with Large Language Models (LLMs) for stock price prediction.

## Overview

This project implements a hybrid approach to stock price prediction by combining:
- Traditional LSTM models for technical analysis and pattern recognition
- LLM-based predictions (using Google's Flan-T5) for fundamental analysis
- Graham's intrinsic value formula for valuation assessment

The system identifies potential high-confidence signals at points where both models agree on price direction.

## Features

- **Hybrid Prediction Algorithm**: Weighted ensemble combining LSTM and LLM predictions
- **Intrinsic Value Calculation**: Implementation of Graham's formula `âˆš(22.5 * EPS * Book Value)`
- **Intersection Analysis**: Identification of points where both models agree
- **Interactive UI**: Gradio-based interface for visualization and analysis
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Includes Docker containerization and DVC for versioning

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.9**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for LSTM implementation
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (Flan-T5) for LLM-based predictions
- **yfinance** for market data acquisition
- **Gradio** for interactive UI
- **Docker** for containerization
- **DVC** for data versioning
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** for data processing and visualization
