Hybrid Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning pipeline that combines LSTM neural networks with Large Language Models (LLMs) for stock price prediction.

Features

1) Hybrid Prediction Approach: Combines traditional LSTM models with LLM-based predictions
2) Stock Value Formula: Implements Graham's formula âˆš(22.5 * EPS * Book Value) for intrinsic value calculation
3) Intersection Analysis: Identifies points where both models agree, potentially indicating strong signals
4) Interactive UI: Gradio-based interface for easy interaction and visualization
5) MLOps Best Practices: Includes logging, testing, CI/CD, and experiment tracking
